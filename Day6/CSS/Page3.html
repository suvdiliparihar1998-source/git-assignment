    <h1>External CSS</h1>
    <p>External CSS is a method of styling web pages by storing all the Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) rules in a separate, dedicated file with a .css extension. This file is then linked to multiple HTML documents, allowing developers to control the look and layout of an entire website from a single, centralized place.</p>
