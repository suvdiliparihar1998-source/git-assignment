      <p>
        The CSS descendant selector is a combinator that selects all elements that are descendants (children, grandchildren, etc.) of a specified ancestor element. It is represented by a single whitespace character (a space, tab, or new line) between two or more selectors.

        <p>
          In HTML, nesting involves one element containing another. The inner element is the child, and the outer element is the parent.
